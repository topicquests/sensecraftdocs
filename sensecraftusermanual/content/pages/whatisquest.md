### Details

A Quest is many different things. We seek to understand what constitutes a quest.

Those conversations necessarily include debate, which takes the form of Pro and Con arguments and the justifications for those arguments.

A Questâ€™s conversation is known as a D*ialogue Map*; it is not an *Argument Map*; it seeks to be a civil, evidenced-based *conversation* about complex, sometimes *wicked problems*.
