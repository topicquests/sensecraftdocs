### Details

In the context of global-scale conversations, the *Dunbar Number* suggests limiting the number of people in a local portion of that conversation to a small number, and within that number, group still into smaller groups.

SenseCraft Guilds are private spaces for small groups to work together to contribute to the large scale conversation known as a Quest. Inside that Guild, small groups play different roles to keep specific aspects of the Guildâ€™s internal conversation needs to local specialists: *role players*.

In SenseCraft, Guilds are now divided into two categories:
#### Communities of Practice (CoP)
In which, just like the medieval trade craft guilds, a CoP is created for a specific domain of interest, such as Health Providers, or Climatologists.
#### Teams
Teams, by contrast, are not differentiated by area of interest, but rather are very useful for those who simply want to become proficient as Guild Members.
