### Details

Every Guild needs *leadership*.

By definition, the creator/owner of a Guild is its permanent leader.

Additional leaders can be nominated from the Guild's membership - leaders can be added or removed at the discretion of leadership.

Guild leadership is responsible for every game move made by the Guild.
