### Details

A Knowing Hub, or K-Hub, is a curated set of outcomes from Quests.  We anticipate two types of Quests:

* Isolated Quests to develop novel solutions for specific problems.
* In the Quest/Guild/K-Hub model, only Guilds can provide curated Quest results to the Questâ€™s associated K-Hub.
  
The SenseCraft tools can effectively record discussion and present novel solutions, if appropriate for both types of Quests.

Publishing Quest results to a K-Hub via Guild sponsorship increases institutional memory and over time provides a valuable asset to K-Hub members.
