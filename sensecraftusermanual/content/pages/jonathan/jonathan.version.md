SenseCraft is a social networking game, f√•or which the purpose for playing is to learn **how** to best solve wicked problems and also to **solve** them.

It accumulates a record of activity in a [[khub]], constructed of [[node]]s. Points are awarded for adding and for using nodes. Good practices are also rewarded, so as to encourage trust, reliability, robustness, and fun.

Activity is done through [[game moves]] made during a [[quest]] by one or more [[guild]]s.
