A Game Move starts with an existing [[Node]] in a [[K-Hub]] and ends by adding a new child [[Node]] to it. It advances the [[Quest]] in some significant way. The Game Move may involve one or more tasks.

When you (a member of a [[Guild]]) VISIT a [[Quest]], and if you are logged in and authorized to do so by your [[role]], there will be ways to RESPOND to the [[Quest]]'s question. You can respond by asking a probing question, or you can formulate an answer (take a position). You would rarely ask a question as a response to a [[Quest]], but it can happen.
