[[SenseCraft]] must at its core be **Fun** to play. Its [[Rule]]s and its [[Conversational Literacy]] skills are challenging and rather dry, which we shall need to balance with ample **Fun**. Here are some miniature games which anyone can play, even in real life

### Emotions

Emotions are notoriously irrational and sometimes misdirecting. Gaining awareness and mastery of emotions is a skill that will come in handy while playing [[SenseCraft]] and in real life. Give yourself **rationality** [[Points]] for:

| give yourself this many points | when you |
| :---: | --- |
| 1 | notice that you are upset |
| 2 | don't let your upset hijack your thinking |
| 3 | recover your equanimity |
| 6 | do all of the above for an upset |

<br>
If you find yourself with lots of rationality points, [[SenseCraft]] can convert them into Game [[Points]] at your request.

### Needs

Often enough you might suddenly feel upset or disturbed by a **Need** for something missing. In this miniature game you can become masterful at getting your **Needs** met. Give yourself rationality [[points]] for:

give yourself this many points   |   when you
:---: | ---
 1 | notice that you are upset or disturbed
 2 | identify the Need which is upsetting or disturbing you
 3 | come up with a strategy for filling the need
 4 | deploy the strategy
 5 | fill the Need and recover peace of mind
 15 | do all of the above

<br>

As you pursue resolving a Need, you will likely stumble. You might misidentify the Need or try a Strategy that does not fill it. Give yourself the points for trying and try again.

As your skill grows, you might try guessing the Needs of a fellow player:

give yourself this many points | when you
:---: | ---
 1 | notice that another player is upset or disturbed
 2 | try to identify their Need
 3 | ask the other player if this is their need
 4 | hear the other player confirm your guess
 10 | do all of the above
