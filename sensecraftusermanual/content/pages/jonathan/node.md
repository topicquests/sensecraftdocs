Each Node in the [[K-Hub]] is an idea. Each Node is carefully crafted by [[SenseCraft]] and by players to capture the sense of things at the time. There are four types of node:

 Type | Meaning 
---|---
 Question | Start a [[Quest]]
 Answer | End a [[Quest]]
 Argument | For or Against
 Reference | Supporting an Argument

### Publishing

Nodes also have a publication lifecycle. They begin as very private and pass through many hands before they become fully public, visible even outside [[SenseCraft]]. This passage through many hands is what [[SenseCraft]] is all about.

Stage | Visible to and Promotable by | Private to Author's [[Guild]]
---|---|:---:
private draft  | author of the Node | yes
role draft | others with the author's [[Role]]? | yes
guild draft | everyone in the [[Guild]] | yes
proposed | same, leader or delegate can promote | yes
submitted | same, moderators can promote | yes
published | fully public, no more promotions | visible outside [[SenseCraft]]
