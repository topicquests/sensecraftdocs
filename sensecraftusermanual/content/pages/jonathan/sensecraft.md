SenseCraft is a social networking game for solving [[wicked problem]]s and for learning how to best solve them in teams.

These [[Game Move]]s are at the heart of SenseCraft as they encourage trust, reliability, robustness, and fun, which we call [[conversational literacy]].

Let's pretend to play a [[Quest]]: [[How do I Play SenseCraft]]?
