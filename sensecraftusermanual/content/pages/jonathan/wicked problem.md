Problems and questions that are complex, ill-defined and have enormous impact are known as **Wicked** (which denotes resistance to resolution, rather than evil). They are difficult or impossible to solve because of incomplete, contradictory, and changing requirements that are often difficult to recognize or because a stopping point cannot be adequately specified. Moreover, because of complex interdependencies, the effort to solve one aspect of a **Wicked** problem may reveal or create other problems.

[[Quest]]s are [[SenseCraft]]'s way of pursuing them.

### Jonathan's Proposed List
- How can we make it attractive to the monied wealthy for them to inject enormous funds into programs that fulfill popular needs?
- How can we make it fun for people to learn civility without revealing that that is what [[SenseCraft]] is all about?
- How do we prevent those players who possess a wealth of points from dominating the game, while at the same time giving them something to "buy" with their points?
