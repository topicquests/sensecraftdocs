Problems and questions that are complex, ill-defined and have enormous impact are known as **Wicked** (which denotes resistance to resolution, rather than evil). They are difficult or impossible to solve because of incomplete, contradictory, and changing requirements that are often difficult to recognize or because a stopping point cannot be adequately specified. Moreover, because of complex interdependencies, the effort to solve one aspect of a **Wicked** problem may reveal or create other problems.

[[Quest]]s are [[SenseCraft]]'s way of pursuing them.

For example, how can we make it attractive to the wealthy for them to inject enormous funds into programs that fulfill popular needs? Or, how can we make it fun for people to learn civility without revealing that that is what [[SenseCraft]] is all about?
