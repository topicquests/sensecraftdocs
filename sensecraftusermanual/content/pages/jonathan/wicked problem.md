Problems and questions that are complex, ill-defined and have enourmous impact are known as Wicked. [[Quest]]s are [[SenseCraft]]'s way of pursuing them.

For example, how can we make it attractive to the wealthy for them to inject enormous funds into programs that fulfill popular needs? Or, how can we make it fun for people to learn civility without revealing that that is what [[SenseCraft]] is all about?
