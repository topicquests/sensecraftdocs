A Guild is a private space for one or more small groups to work together to contribute to a [[Quest]]. Guilds are responsible for organizing these small groups and train them to pursue [[Quest]]s with [[civility]].

Each member of a Guild plays a specific [[role]].

It may come to pass that some guilds evolve to just ask questions, others to formulate only positions with evidence, and yet others to challenge all [[game move]]s.

In the [[Quest]]/Guild/[[K-Hub]] model, only Guilds can provide curated Quest results to the [[Quest]]’s associated [[K-Hub]].

Okay then, [[how do I join a Guild]]?
