A guild is a private space for one or more small groups to work together to contribute to the large scale conversation known as a Quest.

Each small group within a guild plays a specific [[role]]. Each role is responsible for specific aspects of the Guild’s internal conversation.

In the Quest/Guild/K-Hub model, only Guilds can provide curated Quest results to the Quest’s associated K-Hub.
