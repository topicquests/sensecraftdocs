Some [[Guild]]s provide training and are known as a Community of Practice. Such Guilds do not perform Quests. Instead, the provide guidance, manuals, classes and mentoring.

## Request for Guidance

As you play, if you need extra insight into, say, [[Conversational Literacy]], a [[Role]] or a [[Game Move]], find the Community of Practice [[Guild]] whose training comes closest and pose a Request for Guidance. The more quickly that that [[Guild]] response to your request, the faster yoy can resume your contributions to [[SenseCraft]], so such requests probably need to be prioritized and the response process optimized by [[SenseCraft]].
