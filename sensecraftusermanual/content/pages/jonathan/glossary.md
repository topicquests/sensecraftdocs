## Boundary Infrastructure (TODO)

## Attractor Basin

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attractor)

In the [mathematical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics) field of [dynamical systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_system), an attractor is a set of numerical values toward which a system tends to evolve, for a wide variety of starting conditions of the system.

While that is a rather esoteric concept, it is not necessary to know what mathematics has to say about this subject, but rather to grasp the nature and importance of the subject itself. Consider the behaviors of, say, the Red Cross: lots of capable people living out their lives until some major event (flood, earthquake, say) happens, at which point, they come together and solve the problem, then move back to their normal routines. This is technically known as swarm behavior. The important concept to keep in mind is that this is how complex-adaptive systems such as humans behave.

## Complex, Adaptive System (CAS)

All living organisms are CAS, as compared to machines, no matter how complicated those machines might be. Complex systems rely on feedback, and decay (forgetting) to continuously adjust their behaviors. From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_adaptive_system):

A complex adaptive system is a [system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_theory) that is [complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_system) in that it is a [dynamic network of interactions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_network_analysis), but the behavior of the ensemble may not be predictable according to the behavior of the components. It is [adaptive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_system) in that the individual and [collective behavior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_behavior) mutate and [self-organize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-organizing) corresponding to the change-initiating micro-event or collection of events.

A concept crucial to CAS is [Emergence](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XTk9mKBIIKqWSLdjbwjdcuWo6528HaHPE6NzJ52VEWg/edit#heading=h.wpoed4qh4675).

## Conversation Tree

A conversation tree is a graph - nodes with arcs between them - rooted in a question, a Quest. In general, each node connects to one and only one parent node; that is, an idea or answer responds to just one question; a pro or con argument responds to just one parent node.

Conversation trees are constructed only through [game moves](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XTk9mKBIIKqWSLdjbwjdcuWo6528HaHPE6NzJ52VEWg/edit#heading=h.wpoed4qh4675) by guilds.

## Dialogue Mapping

Fundamentally, a conversation tree about conversations. Sometimes, this process occurs when facilitators record an ongoing conversation into a tree. Sometimes, the participants in a conversation - including guilds - build the tree themselves.

From Dr. Jeff Conklin’s [website](https://www.cognexus.org/id41.htm):

Dialogue Mapping™ is a radically inclusive facilitation process that creates a diagram or 'map' that captures and connects participants' comments as a meeting conversation unfolds. It is especially effective with highly complex or “Wicked” problems that are wrought with both social and technical complexity, as well as a sometimes maddening inability to move forward in a meaningful and cost effective way.

Dialogue Mapping™ creates forward progress in situations that have been stuck; it clears the way for robust decisions that last. It is effective because it works with the non-linear way humans really think, communicate, and make decisions

## Emergence

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence)

In [philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy), [systems theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_theory), [science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science), and [art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art), emergence occurs when an entity is observed to have properties its parts do not have on their own, properties or behaviors which emerge only when the parts interact in a wider whole.

Emergence plays a central role in theories of [integrative levels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrative_level) and of [complex systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_system). For instance, the phenomenon of [life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life) as studied in [biology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology) is an emergent property of [chemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemistry), and [psychological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology) phenomena emerge from the [neurobiological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurobiology) phenomena of living things.

From this [piece](https://gemmajiang.medium.com/complexity-science-and-convergence-research-a-match-made-in-heaven-2fc780c8ae1c):

Emergence: global outcome arising from local interactions

Complex systems operate in far-from-equilibrium conditions with latent potential for transformation. Change does not need to be imposed from external environments or top-down hierarchical power, as is traditionally understood. Instead, change happens due to interaction between agents in the system and the nonlinear feedback process characteristic of far-from-equilibrium conditions.

## Game Mechanics (TODO)

## Game Move

A game move in this context is how a [conversation tree](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XTk9mKBIIKqWSLdjbwjdcuWo6528HaHPE6NzJ52VEWg/edit#heading=h.me7c3ki7a6t1) is constructed. A game move could be a single node as a response to some parent node, or it could be an entire subtree which is attached to a chosen parent node.

## Guild Social Dynamics

Relates to [Game Mechanics](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XTk9mKBIIKqWSLdjbwjdcuWo6528HaHPE6NzJ52VEWg/edit#heading=h.m4z8ozr8powl). (TODO)

## Issue-based Information Systems (IBIS)

A kind of structured conversation mechanism of recording free-form conversations, adding structure, and using that as a kind of feedback loop for participants in the conversation. Invented at UC Berkeley, it is a way to tame so-called wicked problems.

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Issue-based_information_system):

The issue-based information system (IBIS) is an [argumentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argumentation)-based approach to clarifying [wicked problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicked_problem)—complex, ill-defined problems that involve multiple [stakeholders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stakeholder_(corporate)).[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Issue-based_information_system#cite_note-IBIS1970-1) [Diagrammatic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagrammatic) visualization using IBIS notation is often called issue mapping.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Issue-based_information_system#cite_note-Knowledge_Cartography-2):ix

IBIS was invented by Werner Kunz and [Horst Rittel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horst_Rittel) in the 1960s. According to Kunz and Rittel, "Issue-Based Information Systems (IBIS) are meant to support coordination and planning of political decision processes. IBIS guides the [identification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_finding), [structuring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_shaping), and [settling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_solving) of issues raised by problem-solving groups, and provides information pertinent to the [discourse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discourse)."[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Issue-based_information_system#cite_note-IBIS1970-1)

Subsequently, the understanding of planning and design as a process of argumentation (of the designer with himself or with others) has led to the use of IBIS in [design rationale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_rationale),[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Issue-based_information_system#cite_note-Rittel_Nobel_1988-3)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Issue-based_information_system#cite_note-15_years-4) where IBIS notation is one of a number of different kinds of rationale notation.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Issue-based_information_system#cite_note-5) The simplicity of IBIS notation, and its focus on questions, makes it especially suited for representing conversations during the early exploratory phase of problem solving, when a problem is relatively ill-defined.

## Issue Mapping

A process where a particular document is harvested into a conversation tree.

From Dr. Jeff Conklin’s [website](http://www.cognexus.org/issue_mapping_faqs.htm):

Issue Mapping is the process of crafting an issue map, a way of making critical thinking visible.  An issue map is a graphical network that integrates many problems, solutions, and points of view and shows the [deep structure](http://www.cognexus.org/deep_structure.htm) of an issue.

Issue maps can be sketched on paper, but larger issue maps are typically crafted using a software tool such as Compendium.

Issue Mapping frames things as issue-based rather than the conversational basis that we humans most often use, which favors dualistic (either-or) thinking, sloppy arguments, lack of evidence, tangents, implicit assumptions, skipped steps, bias, and over-simplification. Issue Mapping admits all viewpoints and offers a way of engaging and understanding an issue in a whole sense.  The map holds competing views and contending actions in place visually, so that the brain can absorb the bigger picture and appreciate the validity and value of a larger perspective.  Issue Mapping helps groups avoid jumping to easy answers or superficial conclusions, and promotes deeper reasoning, rigor, and even wisdom.

## Knowledge Federation

There are two senses for the term knowledge federation:

Noun

A federation - as in library - a kind of well-groomed collection of information resources

Verb

The process of bringing together information artifacts collected and co-created by participants in an unbiased and trusted way.

## Knowledge Garden - Knowing Garden

The term “knowledge garden” has been around since forever. The context in which we use the term emerged in a 2007 talk in Seoul in which there was an intention to describe a space in which lifelong learning could occur.

We have more recently switched to the active sense of the term: Knowing Garden. 

A slide presentation about this topic is [here](https://www.slideshare.net/jackpark/knowledge-garden-overview).

## Role-playing Game

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_game):

A role-playing game (sometimes spelled roleplaying game;[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_game#cite_note-secondperson-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_game#cite_note-gurpsrp-2) abbreviated RPG) is a [game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game) in which players assume the roles of [characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Player_character) in a fictional [setting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Setting_(narrative)). Players take responsibility for acting out these roles within a [narrative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrative), either through literal [acting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acting), or through a process of structured decision-making regarding character development.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_game#cite_note-Cover-3) Actions taken within many games succeed or fail according to a formal [system of rules and guidelines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_game_system).[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_game#cite_note-4)

## Theory U

From Otto Scharmer’s [page](https://www.ottoscharmer.com/theoryu):

Imagine a leap from our current self to our emerging future Self. We are facing that threshold, gap, chasm or abyss on all levels of scale: as individuals, groups, organizations, and as a global community. How can we activate our deeper levels of humanity in order to bridge and cross that divide? This is the organizing question and journey of Theory U

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_U):

Theory U is a change management method and the title of a book by [Otto Scharmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_Scharmer).[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_U#cite_note-TheoryU-1) Scharmer with colleagues at MIT conducted 150 interviews with entrepreneurs and innovators in science, business, and society and then extended the basic principles into a theory of learning and management, which he calls Theory U.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_U#cite_note-TheoryU-1) The principles of Theory U are suggested to help political leaders, civil servants, and managers break through past unproductive patterns of behavior that prevent them from empathizing with their clients' perspectives and often lock them into ineffective patterns of decision making.

At the core of the "U" theory is presencing: sensing + presence. According to The Learning Exchange,[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_U#cite_note-5) Presencing is a journey with five movements:

We move down one side of the U (connecting us to the world that is outside of our institutional bubble) to the bottom of the U (connecting us to the world that emerges from within) and up the other side of the U (bringing forth the new into the world).

On that journey, at the bottom of the U, lies an inner gate that requires us to drop everything that isn't essential. This process of letting-go (of our old ego and self) and letting-come (our highest future possibility: our Self) establishes a subtle connection to a deeper source of knowing. The essence of presencing is that these two selves – our current self and our best future self – meet at the bottom of the U and begin to listen and resonate with each other. Once a group crosses this threshold, nothing remains the same. Individual members and the group as a whole begin to operate with a heightened level of energy and sense of future possibility. Often they then begin to function as an intentional vehicle for an emerging future.

## Wicked Problem

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicked_problem):

In planning and policy, a wicked problem is a problem that is difficult or impossible to solve because of incomplete, contradictory, and changing requirements that are often difficult to recognize. It refers to an idea or problem that cannot be fixed, where there is no single solution to the problem; and "wicked" denotes resistance to resolution, rather than evil.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicked_problem#cite_note-1) Another definition is "a problem whose social complexity means that it has no determinable stopping point".[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicked_problem#cite_note-2) Moreover, because of complex [interdependencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interdependencies), the effort to solve one aspect of a wicked problem may reveal or create other problems.
