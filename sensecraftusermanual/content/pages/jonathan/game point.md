Game Points reflect how much value you are adding to SenseCraft's other players.

They are awarded for adding and for using [[node]]s.

Good practices are also rewarded, so as to encourage trust, reliability, robustness, and fun.

A player with lots of rationality points can request that they be converted into game points.
