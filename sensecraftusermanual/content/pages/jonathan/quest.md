A quest is a journey from a problem statement to its solution. The problem statement is used to define and to inspire a _truth-seeking mission_. This mission is a conversation recorded in the khub and known as a D*ialogue Map*.

Those conversations necessarily include debate, which takes the form of Pro and Con arguments and the justifications for those arguments. SenseQuest strongly encourages the best possible justifications for such solutions (e.g., evidence and provenance) and [[civility]].

We anticipate two types of quests:

-   Isolated Quests to develop novel solutions for specific problems.
-   In the Quest/Guild/K-Hub model, only Guilds can provide curated Quest results to the Quest’s associated K-Hub.
