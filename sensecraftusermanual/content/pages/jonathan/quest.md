A Quest is a journey from a problem statement (an existing [[Node]]) to its solution (a new child [[Node]]). 

The problem statement is used to define and to inspire a _truth-seeking mission_. This mission is a large scale conversation, known as a D*ialogue Map*, and is recorded in the [[K-Hub]].

These conversations necessarily include debate, which takes the form of Pro and Con arguments and the justifications for those arguments. SenseQuest strongly encourages the best possible justifications for such solutions (e.g., evidence and provenance).

During Quests, SenseCraft encourages and rewards [[civility]].

We anticipate two types of Quests:

-   Isolated Quests to develop novel solutions for specific problems.
-   In the Quest/[[Guild]]/[[K-Hub]] model, only [[Guild]]s can provide curated Quest results to the Quest’s associated [[K-Hub]].

Okay then, [[how do I create a Quest]]?
