SenseCraft creates a _conversation tree_ which we call a **knowing hub** or k-hub for each [[guild]]. It is a hierarchal structure of [[node]]s.

Each k-hub is an historical record of problems, solutions, and of the journeys from one to the other. Each such journey is called a [[quest]]. The k-hub, is a curated set of outcomes from [[quest]]s. 

The SenseCraft tools can effectively record discussion and present novel solutions, if appropriate for both types of Quests.

Publishing Quest results to a K-Hub via Guild sponsorship increases institutional memory and over time provides a valuable asset to K-Hub members.
