[[SenseCraft]] creates _conversation trees_ through [game moves](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XTk9mKBIIKqWSLdjbwjdcuWo6528HaHPE6NzJ52VEWg/edit#heading=h.wpoed4qh4675) by [[Guild]]s, and stores them in  a **knowing hub** or k-hub, one k-hub for each [[Guild]]. It is a hierarchal structure of [[node]]s, in which each node connects to one and only one parent node. An idea or answer responds to just one question; a pro or con argument responds to just one parent node.

Each k-hub is an historical record of [[Quest]]s. It is a growing repository of knowledge of significant value to all [[SenseCraft]] players. Eventually the content of a K-Hub is converted into a Topic Map by software or a Narrative by a person whose Role is Scribe.
