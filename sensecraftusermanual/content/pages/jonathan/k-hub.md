[[SenseCraft]] creates a _conversation tree_ which we call a **knowing hub** or k-hub for each [[Guild]]. It is a hierarchal structure of [[node]]s.

Each k-hub is an historical record of problems, solutions, and of the journeys from one to the other. Each such journey is called a [[Quest]]. The k-hub, is a curated set of outcomes from [[Quest]]s. 

The SenseCraft tools can effectively record discussion and present novel solutions, if appropriate for both types of [[Quest]]s.

Publishing [[Quest]] results to a K-Hub via [[Guild]] sponsorship increases institutional memory and over time provides a valuable asset to K-Hub members.

Eventually the content of a K-Hub is converted into a [[Topic Map]] by software or a [[Narrative]] by a person whose [[role]] is Scribe.
