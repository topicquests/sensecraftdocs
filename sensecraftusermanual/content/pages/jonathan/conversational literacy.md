SenseQuest strongly encourages civility and conversational literacy, allowing players to accomplish more with more delight and less effort.

Although, in simplest terms, it's just an **etiquette**, [[SenseCraft]] is asking a lot from players. When to talk and when to go quiet. How to listen. Be respectful. Stay relevant. It's a **philosophy** as well. An attitude that we are all creating the same single thing, knowing exactly what it is.

### Listening and talking

The Game B concept of Rule Omega is hugely valuable. Do you find it easy to listen for "the signal in the noise" and contribute only what the group needs? We all want to contribute your creativity, insight and passion. Can you ask yourself how your piece fits what is being created? Shall we all learn to spontaneously be brief and pause so others can reflect?

**Empathy**, the ability to accurately guess another's feelings or needs, is one of them. **Tolerance** of difference, dissent, disagreement is another. The rewards that accrue from learning these skills are easily discerned and felt. The following training programs are excellent:

### One topic

Focusing on one topic at a time helps us finish it. Going aside on a tangent may at times seem necessary, but it does disrupt the momentum of pursuing the original topic. Several options are encouraged:

- announce it as important for later
- request an intruding topic and be respectfully brief
- write it down on your note paper and let it go

### Vulnerability

Occasionally, sensitive topics arise because some of the problems we wish to resolve have deep roots in our psyche. Refreshing insight can sometimes come from deep honesty and some of that is vulnerable to social judgement. Feel free to request safety and try to be curious about how to provide it.

### Relationships

We are much more than our passions and skills. We have unique experiences, childhood traumas, medical histories. Each time we meet, we learn more about these individual facets. The more we pay attention, the deeper our **connections** and the more valuable and mature our **relationships**.

### Emotions

It's very easy to weaponize all of this. Ever felt disappointed when someone is behaving uncivil? Does not calling them on it feel upsetting? [[SenseCraft]] assumes all of this is natural and normal. You can play a mini game with rationality points you give yourself:

give yourself this many points | when you
:---:|---
 1 | notice that you are upset
 2 | don't let your upset hijack your thinking
 3 | recover your equanimity
 6 | do all of the above for an upset

If you find yourself with lots of rationality points, [[SenseCraft]] can convert them into [[game point]]s at your request.
