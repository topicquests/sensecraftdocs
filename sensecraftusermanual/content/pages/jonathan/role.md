A **Role** is a set of rules [[Rule]]s governing which tasks and [[Game Move]]s a player assigned that role can or must perform. New players may need to learn [[Skill]]s in order to adopt a **Role**. They should know what **Role** they want to play before joining a [[Guild]]. Each of these will have its own specialty documentation.

## Basic Roles

There are six basic **Roles**, each having specialized responsibilities, partially described here. 

Role | Responsibility
:---: | ---
Leader | organize the [[Guild]], approve all [[Game Move]]s, invent new Roles
Researcher | find supportive material
Philosopher | help plan [[Game Move]]s and nurture epistemology**
Scribe | convert [[K-Hub]] contents into a [[Narrative]]
Critic | 
Default | learn enough to adopt a role, banned from [[Guild]]s

>[!ACTING LEADER]
>If the **Leader** must be absent for a period of time, they can temporarily bestow the **Role** of **Acting Leader** to any fellow [[Guild]] member, so as not to freeze [[Game Move]]s.

## Levels
When a player adopts a Role, the are an Apprentice. As their experience grows, they [[level up]].
