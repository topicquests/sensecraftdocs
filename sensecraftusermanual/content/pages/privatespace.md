### Details

In the context of global-scale conversations, the *Dunbar Number* suggests limiting the number of people in a local portion of that conversation to a small number, and within that number, group still into smaller groups.

SenseCraft Guilds are private spaces for small groups to work together to contribute to the large scale conversation known as a Quest. Inside that Guild, small groups play different roles to keep specific aspects of the Guildâ€™s internal conversation needs to local specialists: *role players*.
