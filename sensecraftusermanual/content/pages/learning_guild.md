### Details

In which, just like the medieval trade craft guilds, a Community of Practice (CoP) is created for a specific domain of interest, such as Health Providers, or Climatologists.

Learning guilds do not directly engage in playing Quests, but experienced members can be called upon by quest sponsors to contribute their expertise in the course of a quest, to identify game moves that exhibit mastery (or ignorance!) of the learning guild's interests.

Members of playing guilds are encouraged to also join learning guilds according to their expertise and interests; a playing guild may choose team members for a quest according to their learning guild membership.
